!!! warning "Key Considerations"
	- Higher amperage is recommended when adding non standard components e.g. thermo fan
	- Lower gauge wiring is recommended if a higher amperage alternator is installed
	- Standard pulley size is required to maintain the alternator's operating RPM in order function effectively

!!! info "Quick Info"
	- All options are bolt in
